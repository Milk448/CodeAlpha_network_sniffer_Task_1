Socket Setup: I create a raw socket to capture IP packets.
Header Parsing: The code unpacks and displays details like IP version, header length, TTL, protocol, source, and destination IP.
Loop: Runs indefinitely to capture packets, displaying each packet's information.
Note: Youâ€™ll need administrator privileges to run this. Replace "YOUR_IP_ADDRESS" with your IP or use "" on Linux.
